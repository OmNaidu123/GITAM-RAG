# RAG MODEL (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## Overview

**Purpose:**  
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances student learning by providing accurate, context-rich answers. It combines real-time information retrieval with natural language generation to:
- Help students understand complex topics more clearly.
- Accelerate research.
- Foster critical thinking by exposing students to reliable sources.

### Key Features

- Accepts user queries and retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base.
- Generates responses that are both context-aware and factually grounded in the retrieved content.
- Seamless integration with user interfaces and real-time interaction capabilities.
- Supports multi-turn interactions for contextual continuity in dialogue.

### Model Architecture

1. **Retriever**  
   Gathers top-k relevant documents from an external corpus using vector similarity or semantic search.

2. **Generator**  
   Produces fluent, contextually enriched responses using the retrieved content, typically powered by a transformer-based model.

## Benefits

- **Increased Accuracy:** Responses are based on factual sources, minimizing hallucinations.
- **Domain Adaptability:** Can integrate with domain-specific corpora (e.g., legal, healthcare, academic).
- **Real-Time Response Generation:** Retrieves and generates answers in near real-time.
- **Explainability:** Traceable sources increase transparency of generated answers.
- **Security and Authentication:**  
  Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for:
  - Secure, stateless, and scalable user verification.
  - Protected API endpoints.
  - Role-based access control.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate, PostgreSQL  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Postman API, ChatGPT API
